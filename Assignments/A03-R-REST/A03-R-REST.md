# REpresentational State Transfer

## 1. What exactly is REST? How does the context of it fits to the title of the dissertation?

REST is a coordinated set of architectural constraints that attempts to minimize latency and network communication while at the same time maximizing the independence and scalability of component implementations. This is achieved by placing constraints on connector semantics where other styles have focused on component semantics. REST enables the caching and reuse of interactions, dynamic substitutability of components, and processing of actions by intermediaries, thereby meeting the needs of an Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system.an optioonal constraint within REST.

## 2. Why is the dissertation considered so important for the software-architectural world?

Because it was through it that the idea of REST was first introduced. 

## 3. Which is the most valuable outcome you personally get from it?

I've learned alot about the idea of REST and why it's so important... However, don't think i will keep from having to make a quick stack check whenever i need to work with REST :)

## 4. How could you implement it in your own practice as a software developer?

I will begin to consider the advantages and disadvanteges before I just blindly choose REST.
